~ Crowd Health Simulation Repository

- This repository is an extension to the conference paper discussing crowd health within crowd simulation. It features an in-depth description of the model design, implementation, and full results evidence, as well as the prototype simulator codebase.
- Enclosed within the documentation and files is: instructions on how to run the adapted simulator prototype; documentation on the simulator design and implementation; equations, tables, graphs, and parameters used for the prototype; the full codebase used to compile the prototype

~ Instructions for how to run the simulator executable

- To run the simulator, the user must have a Windows 64-bit Operating System (Windows 7 or above)
- Inside the simulator directory is a demonstration section with the base case parameter setup, with all .DLLs required to run inside the directory, click the executable
- To compile the simulator, use MinGW to compile the codebase using the "g++" command, with SDL2, GLEW, and GLM installed.
